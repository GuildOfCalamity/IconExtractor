# üíª WinUI3 - Icon Extractor

![Example Picture](./ScreenShot1.png)

* An example of an icon extraction utility which reads the most common Windows DLL assets.
* [Nuget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget) packages utilized:
	- "Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK" Version="1.5.240428000" />
	- "Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools" Version="10.0.22621.3233"
	- "Vanara.Windows.Extensions" Version="4.0.1"
	- "Vanara.Windows.Shell" Version="4.0.1"

* On a side note, does anyone happen to know the story behond this icon? This isn't a rendering artifact; index #2866 in **comres.dll** seems like an internal prank to scribble/deface the asset. Was this done on purpose for some reason? Maybe the effect was to simulate being cracked in half? Out of the thousands of icons I inspected while making this project, only this one stood as an outlier.
